let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments
oh no, it is an ever fixed mark that looks upon tempest but is never shaken
it is a star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come
love alters not with his brief hours or weeks
